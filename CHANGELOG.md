# Changelog

All notable changes to Haven are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Haven uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [1.3.7] — 2025-02-15

### Fixed
- **Voice leave audio cue** — leaving voice chat now plays the descending tone (matching the cue other users already heard) so you get audible confirmation.
- **Stream ghost tiles cleaned up on leave** — all screen-share tiles are properly destroyed when leaving voice. Previously, tiles persisted with dead video sources and showed black screens when restored.

### Added
- **"Left voice chat" toast** — a brief info toast confirms you disconnected, mirroring the existing "Joined voice chat" toast.
- **Escape closes all modals** — pressing Escape now dismisses every open modal overlay (settings, bans, leaderboard, add-server) in addition to the search and theme panels it already handled.

---

## [1.3.6] — 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Noise suppression default lowered to 10%** — 50% was too aggressive for most microphones; new users now start at 10%.
- **RGB theme speed dramatically increased** — previous fastest setting is now the slowest. Uses fixed 16 ms tick with variable hue step (0.8°–4.0° per tick) for smooth, visible cycling.
- **Custom theme triangle now affects backgrounds** — triangle saturation is passed as the vibrancy parameter, so moving the picker visibly changes background tinting, not just accent highlights.
- **Switching to DMs no longer hides voice controls** — voice mute/deafen/leave buttons persist when in a call regardless of which channel is being viewed.
- **Stream "Hide" button removed** — per-tile close buttons are gone; the header minimize button keeps streams accessible and always allows restoring them.
- **Minimize no longer stops your own screen share** — minimizing the stream panel just hides the UI; your share continues broadcasting.

### Added
- **Stream size slider** — a range slider in the streams header adjusts the viewer height (20–90 vh), persisted to localStorage.
- **Theme popup menu** — themes moved from an inline sidebar section (that could scroll off-screen) to a floating popup panel pinned above the sidebar bottom bar. The bottom bar always shows theme/game/leaderboard buttons and the voice bar.

---

## [1.3.5] — 2025-02-14

### Changed
- **Noise suppression → sensitivity slider** — replaced the on/off NS toggle button with an adjustable slider (0–100). Sensitivity maps to the noise gate threshold (0 = off, 100 = aggressive gating). The slider sits inline in the voice controls when in a call.
- **Custom theme overhaul** — the triangle colour picker now dramatically affects the entire UI. Backgrounds, text, borders, links, glow effects, and even success/danger/warning colours are all derived from the chosen hue. The `vibrancy` parameter (used internally) controls how saturated the backgrounds and text become — the triangle’s saturation/value selection now produces visibly different themes instead of only tweaking subtle highlights.

### Added
- **RGB cycling theme** — new 🌈 RGB button in the theme selector. Continuously shifts the entire UI through all hues like gaming RGB peripherals. Two sliders control **Speed** (how fast it cycles) and **Vibrancy** (how saturated/tinted the backgrounds and text become). Settings persist in localStorage.

---

## [1.3.4] — 2025-02-14

### Added
- **Noise suppression (noise gate)** — Web Audio noise gate silences background noise (keyboard, fans, breathing) before sending audio to peers. Runs at 20 ms polling with fast 15 ms attack / gentle 120 ms release. Toggle on/off with the 🤫 NS button in voice controls (enabled by default).
- **Persistent voice across channels** — joining voice in one channel no longer disconnects when switching text channels. A pulsing green voice bar in the sidebar shows which channel you're connected to, with a quick-disconnect button. Voice controls dynamically show/hide based on whether the active text channel matches your voice channel.
- **Server leaderboard** — new 🏆 Leaderboard button in the sidebar opens a modal showing the top 20 Shippy Container scores server-wide, complete with medal indicators for the top 3.

### Fixed
- **Shippy Container frame-rate physics** — game physics normalised to a 60 fps baseline using delta-time scaling. Players on 144 Hz (or any refresh rate) monitors now experience identical gravity, pipe speed, and spawn timing as 60 Hz players. Pipe spawning switched from frame-count based (every 90 frames) to time-based (every 1.5 s). Scale capped at 3× to prevent teleportation on tab-switch.

---

## [1.3.3] — 2025-02-13

### Fixed — Bug Fixes
- **Upload error handling** — both image and file upload handlers now check HTTP status before parsing JSON, giving users clear error messages instead of cryptic "Not Found" toasts.
- **Screen share X button** — clicking close now minimises the screen-share container instead of destroying all streams. A pulsing indicator button appears in the channel header so you can bring the view back. New incoming streams auto-restore the container.
- **Online users visibility** — users are now visible across all channels as soon as they connect, not only in the specific channel they are currently viewing. Disconnect events broadcast to all active channels.
- **DM button feedback** — clicking 💬 now shows a toast ("Opening DM with …"), disables the button during the request, scrolls the sidebar to the newly-opened DM channel, and re-enables after a timeout fallback.

### Changed
- **Tenor → GIPHY migration** — GIF search backend and client switched from Tenor (Google) to GIPHY. New admin setup guide, server proxy endpoints, and response parsing. All `media.tenor.com` URL patterns updated to `media*.giphy.com`. README updated with simpler GIPHY key setup instructions.

### Added
- **Custom theme with triangle picker** — new 🎨 "Custom" button in the theme selector. Opens an inline HSV triangle colour picker (canvas-based hue bar + SV triangle) that live-generates a full theme palette from a single accent colour. Custom HSV values persist in localStorage and apply instantly on page load (no flash).

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-02-12

### Fixed — Security Hardening II
- **Upload serving headers** — non-image uploads now served with `Content-Disposition: attachment`, preventing HTML/SVG files from executing in the browser when accessed directly.
- **Image magic-byte validation** — uploaded images are verified by reading file header bytes (JPEG `FF D8 FF`, PNG `89 50 4E 47`, GIF `GIF8x`, WebP `RIFF…WEBP`), not just MIME type. Spoofed files are rejected and deleted.
- **CSP tightened** — removed `ws:` from `connect-src`, allowing only `wss:` (encrypted WebSocket connections).
- **Inline event handler removed** — link preview `onerror` attribute replaced with delegated JS listener, eliminating a CSP `unsafe-inline` bypass vector.
- **Password minimum raised** — registration now requires 8+ characters (was 6).
- **Account enumeration mitigated** — registration endpoint no longer reveals whether a username is already taken.

### Added — Quality of Life
- **Password change from settings** — new 🔒 Password section in the settings modal lets users change their password (current → new → confirm) without logging out. Backend `POST /api/auth/change-password` issues a fresh JWT on success.
- **Emoji picker upgrade** — categorized tabs (Smileys, People, Animals, Food, Activities, Travel, Objects, Symbols), search bar, scrollable grid with 280+ emojis. Replaces the old flat 40-emoji palette.
- **`/butt` slash command** — `( . )( . )` — companion to `/boobs`.

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-02-12

### Fixed — Security Hardening
- **GIF endpoints now require authentication** — `/api/gif/search` and `/api/gif/trending` were previously unauthenticated, allowing anyone to probe the server and burn Tenor API quota. Now require a valid JWT.
- **GIF endpoint rate limiting** — new per-IP rate limiter (30 req/min) prevents abuse.
- **Version fingerprint removed** — `/api/health` no longer exposes the Haven version number to the public internet.
- **HTTP redirect server (port 3001) hardened** — added rate limiting, `x-powered-by` disabled, header/request timeouts, and replaced open redirect (`req.hostname`) with fixed `localhost` redirect target.
- **DNS rebinding SSRF protection** — link preview endpoint now resolves DNS and checks the resulting IP against private ranges, defeating rebinding attacks where `attacker.com` resolves to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Link preview rate limiting** — new per-IP rate limiter (30 req/min) prevents abuse of the outbound HTTP fetcher.
- **HSTS header** — forces browsers to use HTTPS for 1 year after first visit, preventing protocol downgrade attacks.
- **Permissions-Policy header** — explicitly denies camera, geolocation, and payment APIs to the page.
- **Referrer-Policy header** — `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` prevents full URL leakage in referrer headers.
- **X-Content-Type-Options** — `nosniff` header prevents MIME-type sniffing on uploaded files.
- **Server request timeouts** — headersTimeout (15s), requestTimeout (30s), keepAliveTimeout (65s), and absolute socket timeout (120s) to prevent Slowloris-style attacks.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-02-12

### Added — Direct Messages
- **Private 1-on-1 conversations** — click 💬 on any user in the member list to open a DM.
- DMs appear in a separate "Direct Messages" section in the sidebar.
- If a DM already exists with that user, it reopens instead of creating a duplicate.
- Both users are notified in real-time when a DM is created.

### Added — User Status
- **4 status modes** — Online (green), Away (yellow), Do Not Disturb (red), Invisible (grey).
- **Custom status text** — set a short message (up to 128 chars) visible in the member list.
- **Status picker** — click the status dot next to your username in the sidebar.
- **Auto-away** — automatically switches to Away after 5 minutes of inactivity; returns to Online on activity.
- **Persisted in database** — status survives reconnects and page refreshes.

### Added — Channel Topics
- **Admin-settable topic** — thin topic bar below the channel header with the channel's description.
- Click the topic bar to edit (admin-only). Non-admins see the topic as read-only.
- Topics are stored in the database and broadcast to all channel members on change.

### Added — General File Sharing
- **Upload files up to 25 MB** — PDFs, documents (Word/Excel/PowerPoint), audio (MP3/OGG/WAV), video (MP4/WebM), archives (ZIP/7z/RAR), text, CSV, JSON, Markdown.
- **File attachment cards** — styled download cards with file type icons, names, sizes, and download buttons.
- **Inline audio/video players** — audio and video files render with native HTML5 players directly in chat.
- **Separate upload endpoint** — `/api/upload-file` with expanded MIME whitelist and 25 MB limit.

### Added — Persistent Read State
- **Server-tracked unread counts** — `read_positions` table tracks the last-read message per user per channel.
- Unread badges now survive page refreshes, reconnects, and browser restarts.
- Mark-read is debounced (500 ms) and fires on message load and new message receipt.
- Channels list includes accurate unread counts from the server on load.

### Changed — Database
- New `read_positions` table for persistent unread tracking.
- New columns on `users`: `status`, `status_text`.
- New columns on `channels`: `topic`, `is_dm`.
- New column on `messages`: `original_name` (for file upload metadata).
- All migrations are safe — existing databases upgrade automatically.

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.3.0.
- Member list now shows status dots (colored by status) and custom status text.
- Member list includes a DM button (💬) on each user for quick DM access.
- Channel list split into regular channels and DM section.
- `get-channels` now returns topic, is_dm, dm_target, and server-computed unread counts.
- `emitOnlineUsers` now includes user status and status text in the payload.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-02-12

### Added — Voice UX
- **Join / leave audio cues** — synthesized tones play when users enter or leave voice chat.
- **Talking indicators** — usernames glow green while speaking, with 300 ms hysteresis for smooth animation.
- **Multi-stream screen sharing** — multiple users can share screens simultaneously in a CSS Grid tiled layout with per-user video tiles, labels, and close buttons.

### Added — Message Pinning
- **Pin / unpin messages** (admin-only) — pin button in message hover toolbar.
- **Pinned messages panel** — sidebar panel listing all pinned messages in a channel with jump-to-message.
- **50-pin cap per channel** to prevent abuse.
- **Database-backed** — new `pinned_messages` table with foreign keys; pins survive restarts.

### Added — Enhanced Markdown
- **Fenced code blocks** — triple-backtick blocks with optional language labels render with styled monospace containers.
- **Blockquotes** — lines starting with `>` render with left-border accent styling.

### Added — Link Previews
- **Automatic OpenGraph previews** — shared URLs fetch title, description, and thumbnail server-side.
- **30-minute cache** — previews are cached to avoid repeated fetches.
- **SSRF protection** — private/internal IPs are blocked from the preview fetcher.

### Added — GIF Search
- **Tenor-powered GIF picker** — search and send GIFs inline from the message input.
- **Admin-configurable API key** — Tenor API key can be set from the admin GIF picker UI with an inline setup guide.
- **Server-stored key** — API key saved in `server_settings` DB table (never exposed to non-admins).

### Fixed — Security
- **Admin username hijack via rename** — non-admin users can no longer claim the admin username through `/nick` or rename.
- **XSS via attribute injection** — `_escapeHtml` now escapes `"` and `'` characters, preventing injection through OG metadata or user content.
- **SSRF in link previews** — `/api/link-preview` now blocks requests to localhost, private ranges (10.x, 192.168.x, 172.16-31.x), link-local (169.254.169.254), and internal domains.
- **API key leak** — `get-server-settings` no longer sends sensitive keys (e.g. `tenor_api_key`) to non-admin users.
- **Cross-channel reaction removal** — `remove-reaction` now verifies the message belongs to the current channel.
- **Voice signaling without membership** — `voice-offer`, `voice-answer`, and `voice-ice-candidate` now verify the sender is in the voice room.
- **Typing indicator channel check** — typing events now verify the user is in the claimed channel.

### Fixed — Bugs
- **Voice audio broken** — eliminated duplicate `MediaStreamSource` creation; single source now splits to analyser and gain node.
- **Spotty talking indicator** — added 300 ms sustain hysteresis to prevent flicker during natural speech pauses.
- **Screen share invisible** — added SDP rollback for renegotiation glare, `event.streams[0]` for proper stream association, `track.onunmute`, and explicit `play()` on muted video tiles.
- **GIF send completely broken** — fixed wrong property names (`channelCode` → `code`, `this.replyTo` → `this.replyingTo`) that silently dropped every GIF message.
- **Reconnect dead channel** — socket reconnect now re-emits `enter-channel`, `get-messages`, `get-channel-members`, and other state-restoring events.
- **Screen share privacy leak** — closing the screen share viewer now actually stops the broadcast (calls `stopScreenShare()`) instead of just hiding the UI.
- **Auto-scroll failure** — `_scrollToBottom` after appending messages now uses the force flag to prevent large messages from blocking scroll.
- **Delete-user FK violation** — user deletion now cleans up `pinned_messages`, `high_scores`, `eula_acceptances`, and `user_preferences` to prevent foreign key errors.
- **Delete-channel incomplete** — channel deletion now explicitly removes associated pinned messages.
- **Delete-message incomplete** — message deletion now removes associated pinned message entries.
- **LIKE wildcard injection** — search-messages now escapes `%`, `_`, and `\` in search queries.

### Changed — Performance
- **N+1 query eliminated** — `get-messages` replaced 240 individual queries (for 80 messages) with 3 batch queries using `WHERE ... IN (...)` for reply context, reactions, and pin status.

### Changed
- `edit-message`, `delete-message`, `pin-message`, `unpin-message` DB operations wrapped in try/catch for graceful error handling.
- Version bumped to 1.2.0.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-02-11

### 🔒 Data Isolation

All user data now lives **outside** the Haven code directory, making it physically impossible to accidentally commit or share personal data.

### Changed
- **Database, .env, certs, and uploads** are now stored in:
  - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Haven\`
  - **Linux / macOS:** `~/.haven/`
- **SSL certificates are auto-detected** — if certs exist in the data directory, HTTPS enables automatically without needing to edit `.env`.
- **Start Haven.bat** and **start.sh** generate certs and bootstrap `.env` in the external data directory.
- **Automatic one-time migration** — existing data in the old project-directory locations is moved to the new data directory on first launch.

### Added
- New `src/paths.js` module — single source of truth for all data directory paths.
- `HAVEN_DATA_DIR` environment variable — override where data is stored.

### Updated
- README.md, GUIDE.md, and .env.example updated to reflect new data locations.
